\usage{
byTileAOP(
  dpID,
  site,
  year,
  easting,
  northing,
  buffer = 0,
  include.provisional = FALSE,
  check.size = TRUE,

\arguments{
\item{dpID}{The identifier of the NEON data product to pull, in the form DPL.PRNUM.REV, e.g. DP1.10023.001}

\item{site}{The four-letter code of a single NEON site, e.g. 'CLBJ'.}

\item{year}{The four-digit year to search for data. Defaults to 2017.}

\item{easting}{A vector containing the easting UTM coordinates of the locations to download.}

\item{northing}{A vector containing the northing UTM coordinates of the locations to download.}

\item{buffer}{Size, in meters, of the buffer to be included around the coordinates when determining which tiles to download. Defaults to 0. If easting and northing coordinates are the centroids of NEON TOS plots, use buffer=20.}

\item{include.provisional}{T or F, should provisional data be included in downloaded files? Defaults to F. See https://www.neonscience.org/data-samples/data-management/data-revisions-releases for details on the difference between provisional and released data.}

\item{check.size}{T or F, should the user approve the total file size before downloading? Defaults to T. When working in batch mode, or other non-interactive workflow, use check.size=F.}

\item{savepath}{The file path to download to. Defaults to NA, in which case the working directory is used.}

\item{token}{User specific API token (generated within data.neonscience.org user accounts)}
}
\value{
A folder in the working directory, containing all files meeting query criteria.
