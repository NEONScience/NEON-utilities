Description: NEON data packages can be accessed through the NEON Data Portal (http://data.neonscience.org)
    or through the NEON Data API (see http://data.neonscience.org/data-api for documentation). Data delivered from
    the Data Portal are delivered as monthly zip files packaged within a parent zip file, while individual files
    can be accessed from the API. This package provides tools that aid in discovering, downloading, and reformatting 
    data prior to use in analyses. This includes downloading data via the API, grouping data by type, and converting 
    formats. This package is still in development and subject to change. For more information, see the readme file
    at https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-utilities.
